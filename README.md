# Medal take-home code challenge:

At Medal, we want to learn about your coding skills in a way that is more akin to the way you would normally work, and the way we work on a day to day basis. We know that nobody can solve a difficult problem with someone looking over their shoulder, and no one has ever written good code on a whiteboard. So, rather than a high-pressure live coding exercise in a browser, or worse while awkwardly standing in front of a group of strangers, you should use your own development environment and preferred toolset wherever you feel most comfortable working.

We feel this should take you about an hour to complete, but that isn’t a hard deadline. Ideally you’ll enjoy the challenge!

You could think of this challenge as a task in your sprint, and when you’re done, your Pull Request will be reviewed by the team. Aside from solving the task at hand, we’ll also get a feel for what it would be like to code with you. When you’re done, submit your work with any notes or docs you might have, and we’ll take a look.

Remember that other people will come across your code in the future (maybe even yourself), and the faster they can figure out how you solved the problem (and what you were solving for), the faster they can get starting on new features or squashing bugs.

The coding project is contained in this repository. The challenge is named `vending_machine` and instructions are outlined in `vending_machine/README.md`. Your solution should be written in a recent release of Python 3 (3.6 or 3.7).

When you’re happy with your code, please submit an archive (tar or zip file) containing your solution via email.
